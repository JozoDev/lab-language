# lab-language
Welcome to my language lab! 🧪 This is where I experiment, break, fix, and learn multiple programming languages - one line of code at a time.

## 🌐 What's Inside?

This repository is my digital journal of learning across multiple programming languages. It's filled with:

- Code snippets 🧩
- Practice projects 🚧
- Study notes 📒
- Debugging chaos and triumphs 💥

## 💻 Languages I'm Playing With

- C#
- More soon...

## 📍 Why I Made This

To track my progress, reinforce what I’ve learned, and maybe help someone else along the way.

Pull up a chair. Let's code. 🧬
